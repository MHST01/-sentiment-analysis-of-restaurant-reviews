** Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Review System** using Machine learning algorithm...!!
Customer reviews are now a crucial component in determining a restaurant's success in the digital age. Restaurants receive a lot of input from patrons reflecting their experiences and level of satisfaction thanks to the widespread use of internet review sites such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews. Sentiment analysis, which is a branch of natural language processing (NLP), is an effective method for determining customer sentiment automatically from textual reviews. This work proposes a method for sentiment analysis that is specifically tailored to restaurant reviews. It uses machine learning techniques to categorise reviews into three types of sentiments: neutral, negative, and positive.
